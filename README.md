# P_G_Global_Innovation_Challenge

Project has two parts

1. Customer Segmentation done using K means algorithm using scikit package in python.

2. Customer Cashback model a neural network, with multi input and multi output model using keras and tf as backend.
   It uses functional API in keras to model the neural network.

Apart from that repository contains the code for dataset generators for respective clustering and neural netowrk training,
evaluation and prediction.


PREREQUISITES:
Code has been tested to run on Ubuntu 16.04 

1.Keras with tf as backend installed via miniconda.

2.Packages like numpy,scipy,matplotlib installed.
